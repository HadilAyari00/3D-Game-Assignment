# 3D-Game-Assignment

In this assignment, I got to change some textures, some lighting and I changed the mouvement of the Dudes to go in a circular motion to make it harder to shoot.

Originally, I intended this to feel like an alien invasion game where you were a space warrior and had to shoot the UFOs (which is why i chose the enemies to move in a circular motion like in the movies). 

However, I have been trying for multiple days and I have struggled with many errors when I attempt to add or replace 3D models. 
**! I will be still be trying to make the models work meanwhile !**
