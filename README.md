# 3D-Game-Assignment
**WARNING !** It contains audio so please adjust your volume accordingly

In this assignment, my goal was to imagine a situation where we take on the role of an alien. In this scenario, we have managed to control a group of humans and have them moving in circles, which is similar to what you might have seen in older alien movies.  
With the humans now under our control, we can proceed with the next phase of our mission, which involves eliminating them without resistance.

**Changes**  
- Changed textures of our map
- Changed lighting to give it a darker mood more fit for the scenario
- Changed camera angles
- Changed Dudes movement patterns and sizes
- Changed main player with a ufo model
- Changed cannonballs to match the positioning of the ufo
- Changed laser to look like it was shooting out of the ufo
- Other general adjustments to code
